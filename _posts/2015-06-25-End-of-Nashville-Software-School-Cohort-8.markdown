#End of Nashville Software School

Friday June 26th, 2015 is the day I have been working towards for the
past six months. NSS Cohort 8 demo day starts tomorrow at 11 a.m. and
lasts until 1 p.m. We will show off our Back-end and most likely our
front-end apps.

My front-end app is not finished. I could not find an api that would
give me what I wanted (for free anyway) so during the second half I
built an API in Rails that would give me a simplified version of the
info I needed. The front end is being made with Ember. Currently I am
having an issue with the data being recieved by ember. It is not sent
in an array I belive. But that is something to tackle over the
weekend.

My back-end app is working however, and working quite well I believe.
It is a small social networking app for NSS gradutes. I built it with my
time limit in mind, so I would not be scambling to finish at the
last minute. The only downside is that I feel like I did not push the
boundaries of what I am capable of. It was started with all the features
being tested, but some of the later and smaller features were not implemented with
tests. Styling is atrocious. I admit that. I never claimed to be an
expert and since it was a back-end app I focused on the Rails portion.

As I said before I am happy with what I have and If you would like to
