#Hack Tennessee 7

Last Friday (May 1st) was the first time I attended a hackathon. I volunteered to set up some of the finale things: cover the tables, tape the power cords down, and set up some signs. It was nothing big, but they took from 9:45 until 3 in the afternoon to finish.

At 7 p.m. the project ideas where pitched and I joined Ayumi Bennett’s group Snack TN. It’s a website that lists food, beer, and other items made in Tennessee. Several other people from NSS joined our group. I am now teaming up with Code for Nashville to turn this project into a full fledged app.

The experience was hectic and awesome and I recommend to anyone, no matter the level, to go to one of these events. It is a great way to learn and meet new people.
