#A Fourth of July Elixir?

Ever since I saw Bryan Hunter's talk on Elixir earlier this year at the
Nash.rb meetup I have had an intense desire to check it out but I held
off on it to concentrate on Ruby and JavaScript. Now that I have
finished NSS I feel I'm in a good place to pick up Elixir. Also it's
Fourth of July weekend and coding with a beer is my way of celebrating!

I am starting with the Mix and OTP guide on [elixir-lang.org](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html). It's seems pretty good and is very understandable. So far everything seems very similar to ruby, which I like. I am going to hold off on touching the Phoenix framework until I have a grasp on the Elixir language itself.

I don't think that learning any of the popular tools for Elixir will be
particularly difficult. [Awesome-elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir) is an awesome (see what I did there) resource for learning elixir tools.

If anyone wants to hack on an Elixir project or just talk about
functional programming in general feel free to hit me up!
