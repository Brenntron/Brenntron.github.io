Hi, I'm Brennan - a web developer with a passion for technology and emational intelligence. I'm looking for a team that shares my passions and interests. Let's chat soon.

My contact info and Github link are in the footer. Feel free to contact me in way that is convenient.

I can make a long list of programming languages I'm intersted in, but the short list is Ruby and JavaScript. I'm also currently exploring some functional languages like Clojure, Haskell, and Elixir.
