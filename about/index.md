Hi, I'm Brennan - a full-stack web developer in the Nashville area with emotional intelligence and a passion for technology. I have a taste for good bourbon and cigars and enjoy a challenge.

My contact info and Github link are in the footer. Feel free to contact me in anyway that is convenient for you.

I can make a long list of programming languages I'm interested in, but the short list is Ruby and JavaScript. I'm also currently exploring some functional languages like Elixir.
